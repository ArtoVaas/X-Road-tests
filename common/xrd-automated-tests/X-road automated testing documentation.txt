<h1>Table of Contents</h1>




<h1>Introduction</h1>

This document holds the information and instructions for the X-ROAD automated tests. The document introduces the project architecture and describes packages and more important classes and methods.

Firstly, the document introduces technologies which were used in the creation of the project. It also describes the plugins, packages and libraries needed for executing the project was agreed upon.

Secondly, the architecture of the project is described. Specifically, packages, classes and methods are described in detail.

Finally Jenkins project configuration is brought out and how to execute the test. In similar manner it is possible to run other tests too.



<h1>1.Used Technologies</h1>
<h2>1.1Programming languages</h2>

Automatic tests are created using Python (version 2.7)

<h1>2 Framework description</h1>

The main class in the test framework is **main.MainController**. This communicates with the browser, handles exceptions and provides configuration parameters to the tests using a **helpers.ConfReader** instance.


<h2>2.1 Framework structure</h2>

The framework consists of Python packages that contain classes, view models and helper files. Helper files contain functions used by different classes.

The framework also requires a mock service to be running and accessible from security servers. This is not part of the testing framework but as it is a required service, it is also described in this chapter.

The framework also requires an HTTP server that serves WSDL files (service descriptions) to the security server. This is not part of the testing framework but as it is a required service, the WSDL files are also described in this chapter.

<h2>2.2 List of framework packages (directories)</h2>

| temp | Temporary data created from tests |
| tests | Tests. |
| view\_models | Page or object related functions and constants. |
The list of packages and directories in the framework is shown in Table 1.

_Table 1. List of framework packages._

| **Package** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| helpers | Other classes and helper functions. |
| main | Main framework controller classes. |
| mock | Certificates and queries for mocking services |

<h2>2.3 Helpers Package</h2>

This package holds different helper classes and methods for easier access to resources.

_Table 2. List of files in helpers package_

| **Filename** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| confreader.py | ConfReader class, described later. |
| mockrunner.py | MockRunner class, described later. |
| soaptestclient.py | SoapTestClient class, described later. |
| ssh\_client.py | SSHClient class, described later. |
| login.py | Holds login, logout and login-checking methods. |
| ssh\_server\_actions.py | Helper functions for checking XRoad logs and other server specific methods. |
| ssh\_user\_actions.py | Helper functions for manipulating Linux users. |
| webdriver\_init.py | Helper functions for creating browser instances. |
| xroad.py | Helper functions for XRoad datatypes. |

<h2>2.4 ConfReader class (confreader.py)</h2>

ConfReader is a class for storing and reading parameters from different sources. It supports reading parameters from command-line arguments, INI files, JSON files and text files containing one key=value pair on each line (ignoring empty lines).

**Configuration parsing**

INI files, config files and command-line arguments are all parsed to detect types (Boolean, None, string, integer, float) automatically. Values are initially loaded as strings and type detection is necessary for some methods that need integers or floats as input. The values are automatically checked for text &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;None&quot;, and numeric values. Because keeping a numeric value as string may sometimes be necessary, type detection can be avoided by wrapping the value inside single quotes (&#39;), example: age=&#39;14&#39;.

**Configuration examples setting the following values:**

| additional\_info=None (NoneType)person.name=&quot;John Doe&quot; (string)person.age=24 (integer)person.tv\_show=&quot;24&quot; (string)person.married=True (Boolean) |
| --- |

**Command-line arguments**

Each argument needs to be prefixed with two dashes (--). Long values should be wrapped inside double quotes (&quot;), values without spaces do not need to be wrapped.

Example assumes script filename of _test.py_

| python test.py --additional\_info=None --person.name=&quot;John Doe&quot; --person.age=24 --person.tv\_show=&quot;&#39;24&#39;&quot; --person.married=True |
| --- |

<h3>2.4.1 INI file (ini\_path)</h3>

INI files ignore empty lines and comment lines starting with a semicolon (;). ConfReader parameter names are constructed from section and key names, concatenated with a dot (.). Section [MAIN] (capital letters) is a special section that will not be used as a prefix.

Sections can be used for grouping parameters, but everything can be written under MAIN.

If command-line arguments are parsed (_init\_command\_line=True_ when initializing the class), INI file can be specified with argument **--ini=/path/to/file.ini**.

| ; Grouped parameters[MAIN]additional\_info=None[person]name=John Doeage=24tv\_show=&#39;24&#39;married=True | ; Everything grouped under MAIN [MAIN]additional\_info=Noneperson.name=John Doeperson.age=24person.tv\_show=&#39;24&#39;person.married=True |
| --- | --- |

<h3>2.4.2 Text file (config\_file)</h3>

Each line consists of key=value pair. Empty lines are ignored. Lines without an equals sign (=) are ignored and can be used as comments.

If command-line arguments are parsed (_init\_command\_line=True_ when initializing the class), configuration file can be specified with argument **--config=/path/to/file**.

| This is an example config file additional\_info=Noneperson.name=John Doeperson.age=24person.tv\_show=&#39;24&#39;person.married=True |
| --- |

<h3>2.4.3 JSON file</h3>

The advantage of using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is that values are converted to dictionaries without parsing them.

| {&quot;additional\_info&quot;: &quot;None&quot;, &quot;person.name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;person.age&quot;: 24, &quot;person.tv\_show&quot;: &quot;24&quot;, &quot;person.married&quot;: true} |
| --- |

If command-line arguments are parsed (_init\_command\_line=True_ when initializing the class), JSON file can be specified with argument **--json=/path/to/file**.

<h2>2.5 MockRunner class (mockrunner.py)</h2>

MockRunner is a simple class that controls the mock service script (SoapUI MockRunner) over an SSH connection.

Uses ssh\_helper.SSHClient component. Connects to SSH server, sends a one-liner command and then waits until a specified regex matches output or a timeout occurs. To stop the service, sends a single keycode (Ctrl-C by default).

<h3>2.5.1 Starting the service</h3>

When MockRunner tries to start the service, it goes through the following steps.

1. Connect to service server over SSH
2. Send username and password
3. Execute _command_
4. Check standard output (stdout) on the server and look for _ready\_regex_ match.
5. If match is found, service has been started. If timeout occurs first, service start failed.
6. Control is given back to the calling program.

If any of these steps fail, the service will not be started, start command returns False and MockRunner.error variable will contain an error message.

<h3>2.5.2 Stopping the service</h3>

Stopping the service is done by sending _stop\_keycode_ to standard input (stdin) over the SSH link. No other checks are made.

_Table 4. MockRunner class methods_

| **Method name** | **Method description** |
| --- | --- |
| start() | Start the service. Returns True if service start was detected, False otherwise. |
| stop() | Stop the service by sending _stop\_keycode_ key. |
| restart() | Restart the service by executing stop() and start() in sequence. |
| get\_error() | Returns last start() error or None if no error. |



<h2>2.6 SoapTestClient class (soaptestclient.py)</h2>

SoapTestClient is the test client class for sending SOAP requests to XRoad security servers. The component is used for testing if the services respond, succeed, return an error, and if the return data matches the expected data.

SoapTestClient uses the Python Requests library to send SOAP queries over HTTP(S) and parses response XML to extract XRoad service parameters.

_Table 5. SoapTestClient class methods_

| **Method name** | **Method description** |
| --- | --- |
| query(url=None, body=None, params=None, timeout=None) | Sends a query to the service.  _url_ and _body_ are required parameters. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_query\_success(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None) | Checks if a query succeeds. Sends a query to the service using query() with the same parameters and check if a the response contains a Fault element and if the fault code matches a supplied list of faults. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_query\_loop(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None, fail\_timeout=None, retry\_interval=None, verify\_service=None, check\_success=True) | Checks if a query succeeds or fails (depending on _check\_success_ value) before _query\_timeout_ occurs. Sends a query to the service using check\_query\_success() every _retry\_interval_ seconds until it returns the same value as _check\_success_. If _verify\_service_ is supplied, it then checks if it is a subset of response service parameters. Returns _True_ if all conditions are _True_ before _fail\_timeout_ seconds pass, _False_ otherwise. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_success(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None, fail\_timeout=None, retry\_interval=None, verify\_service=None) | Checks if the query succeeds before _query\_timeout_ occurs. Sends a query to the service using check\_query\_loop() using _check\_success=True_ every _retry\_interval_ seconds until it returns _True_. If a timeout of _query\_timeout_ seconds occurs returns _False_. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_fail(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None, fail\_timeout=None, retry\_interval=None, verify\_service=None) | Checks if a query fails before _query\_timeout_ occurs. Sends a query to the service using check\_query\_loop() using _check\_success=False_ every _retry\_interval_ seconds until it returns _True_. If a timeout of _query\_timeout_ seconds occurs returns _False_. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| get\_service() | Internal method to extract service parameters as a dictionary from latest query response XML. |
| verify\_service(service) | Method to check if _service_ is a subset of last service parameters returned by _get\_service()_ |
| log(str) | Internal default debug logging method. Prints a string to standard output. |

<h2>2.7SSHClient class (ssh\_client.py)</h2>

SSHClient is a simple SSH Client class using the Paramiko library. It connects to an SSH server and allows to execute commands, use standard input, output and receive errors (stdin, stdout, stderr). Connection is made during class initialization and remains open until _close()_ method is called.

_Table 6. SSHClient class methods_

| **Method name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| get\_client() | Returns the Paramiko internal SSHClient instance. |
| exit\_status() | Returns the last command&#39;s exit status code. |

| writeline(line) | Writes a line to remote server, automatically adds a linefeed character. |
| readline() | Reads a line from remote standard output (stdout) and returns it without linefeed characters. |
| exec\_command(command, sudo=False, timeout=None) | Executes a command on the remote server. If _sudo=True_, tries to execute the command with _sudo_ prefix (root rights, user must have _sudo_ access). If _timeout_ in seconds is supplied, sets the Paramiko internal channel timeout. |
| open(host, username, password) | Connects to host over SSH using specified credentials. |
| close() | Closes the connection. |



<h2>2.8 Main Package</h2>

Main package contains two classes: MainController and AssertHelper.

**AssertHelper** is a base class for MainController adding assertion methods that can be used during tests.

**MainController** class is the test framework main controller. It handles and interacts with the web browser, provides helper functions for finding elements, logging in and out of XRoad, basic logging and main configuration parameters.

<h2>2.9 Mock Directory</h2>

Mock directory contains the certificates and XML query bodies that are used by SoapTestClient mock client. It contains two subdirectories.

The &quot;cert&quot; subdirectory contains the certificate (mock.crt) and private key (mock.key) of the mock client, and the certificate of the Mock Service (mockservice.crt, used for verifying the server&#39;s certificate).

The &quot;queries&quot; subdirectory contains query templates that are parsed by SoapTestClient and sent by the server when testing access lists and services themselves. The list of query templates is shown in the following table.

_Table 8. Mock directory files_

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| service.xml | SOAP query template for sending queries to security server services. |
| centralservice.xml | SOAP query template for sending queries to central services. |

<h2>2.13 Mock Service</h2>

The mock service serves SOAP requests from users proxied by the security servers. It is used for testing service parameters and access lists.

The mock service has been made in SoapUI and requires SoapUI to run. The mock service is not directly a part of the framework as it can be configured to be running all the time in a different server or the framework may be configured to use other (or non-SoapUI) services that may already be running.

The mock service location is set in the WSDL files (under _&lt;wsdl:service&gt;_ subelement _&lt;soap:address&gt;_ attribute _location_) and framework configuration parameters _services.test\_service\_url_, _services.test\_service\_2\_url_, _services.test\_service\_url\_ssl_ (HTTPS), _services.test\_service\_2\_url\_ssl_ (HTTPS). The service must listen on two ports, one using regular HTTP protocol and the other using HTTPS.

| Examples of the part of a WSDL file that points to two services that should already be running on localhost port 8086 under different URLs.     &lt;wsdl:service name=&quot;xroadGetRandom&quot;&gt;        &lt;wsdl:port name=&quot;xroadGetRandomPortSoap11&quot;                binding=&quot;tns:xroadGetRandomPortSoap11&quot;&gt;            &lt;soap:address location=&quot;http://localhost:8086/xroadGetRandom&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;    &lt;/wsdl:service&gt;     &lt;wsdl:service name=&quot;bodyMassIndex&quot;&gt;        &lt;wsdl:port name=&quot;bodyMassIndexPortSoap11&quot;                binding=&quot;tns:bodyMassIndexPortSoap11&quot;&gt;            &lt;soap:address location=&quot;http://localhost:8086/bodyMassIndex&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;    &lt;/wsdl:service&gt; |
| --- |

The Mock Service itself is defined in a single XML file (SoapUI project) but as it has to support certificates, it also requires a SoapUI settings file (for supporting SSL), a key store and a certificate file. The list of files required to run the service is in the following table.

_Table 12. Mock service directory files_

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| soapui-settings.xml | SoapUI settings file (XML). Defines SSL port for services to be 18086, keystore file as &quot;mockservice.keystore&quot; and keystore password as &quot;password&quot;. These values can be edited in SoapUI or directly in XML under elements _&lt;con:setting&gt;_ with attributes &quot;id&quot; starting with &quot;SSLSettings&quot;. |
| testservice-soapui-project.xml | Mock service SoapUI project (XML). Defines two services: _xroadGetRandom_ and _bodyMassIndex_, both are run from port 8086 (if SoapUI settings define an SSL port, they are run from the SSL port at the same time as well). Can be edited from SoapUI. |
| mockservice.keystore | Keystore for the mock service. Default keystore password used is &quot;password&quot;. |

<h2>2.14 WSDL files</h2>

The WSDL files are used for providing information about services to the security servers. They describe the service (name and version) and the URL from which the security server can access it. Multiple services can be described in one WSDL.

The test automation scenarios require different WSDL files to test different outcomes - a working WSDL, a WSDL that removes a previously defined service, a WSDL that gives a parser error and a WSDL that gives a parser warning.

The WSDL files have to be served from an HTTP server that is accessible from security servers and accessible over SSH from the test framework (to edit the files remotely). WSDL files base URL is defined in the main configuration with key _wsdl.remote\_path_ and other WSDL parameters are also under _wsdl_ section.

List of WSDL files defined in the default configuration is in the following table.



_Table 13. WSDL files in default configuration_

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| testservice.wsdl | The WSDL that is added to the security servers. As the tests require the same file to be overwritten with others (working, erroneous, warning, removed service), it contains different data at different times. |
| testservice\_original.wsdl | This is the base WSDL file that is working correctly and defines two services: _bodyMassIndex.v1_ and _xroadGetRandom.v1_ |
| testservice\_xroadGetRandom\_only.wsdl | Derived from &quot;testservice\_original.wsdl&quot; but defines only one service: _xroadGetRandom.v1_ |
| error.wsdl | A file that results in a WSDL parser error. |
| warning.wsdl | A file that results in a WSDL parser warning. |
| gatling.wsdl | Used for performance testing. |

<h1>3 Executing tests in Jenkins CI</h1>
<h2>3.1 Project configuration</h2>

1. Choose a freestyle project type
2. Choose project name
3. Add Build step &quot;Custom Python Builder&quot;
  * Home = Python 2.7 location (/usr/bin/python2.7)
  * Nature = Shell
  * Command:

repo\_root\_dir=/opt/riajenk/x-road-tests/
test\_dir=xroad\_everything
test\_name=test\_main
project\_name=testing\_all\_automated\_tests
cd $repo\_root\_dir/tests/$test\_dir
export DISPLAY=:10
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=true
export PYTHONPATH=$repo\_root\_dir
nose2 --plugin nose2.plugins.junitxml  --junit-xml $test\_name
cp $repo\_root\_dir/tests/$test\_name/nose2-junit.xml   /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/$project\_name/

4. Add post build action
  * Publish Junit test result report
  * Add the file name which was previously copied.



![Figure 2. Example Jenkins project configuration](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Figure 2. Example Jenkins project configuration")


<h2>3.2 Starting the project</h2>

Open project or from the projects list open project dropdown and click &quot;Build now&quot;. It is also possible to add build triggers.

<h2>3.3 Test results</h2>

When the test is done, you can see test result in Jenkins. Choose the test which result is wanted. Click on &quot;Latest Test Result&quot;.

The Junit report contains three sections: Result bar, All Failed Tests, and All Tests.


Result bar, show the percentage of failed, skipped and passed test on a line:

 Red - failed tests

 Yelllow - skipped tests

 Blue - passed tests

All Failed Tests table: shows the list of all failed tests.

All Tests table: shows the list of all tests, if test contains multiple tests, one can see them when clicking on the test link.

<h1>4Performance testing Technologies</h1>
<h2>2.1Programming languages</h2>

Performance tests are created using scala programming language.

<h2>4.2 Automation tools</h2>

Performance test is developed to work with Gatling 2.2.3 version.

<h2>4.3 Build management</h2>

Used libraries and other needed software are meant to be installed according to the manual or according to the documentation of the library.

<h3>4.3.1 Used Packages</h3>

* Jenkins
* Gatling

<h3>4.3.2 Used Plugins</h3>

* Junit Plugin

<h2>4.4 Mock</h2>

Mock sends out the messages with the size what gatling script says. Sends them against the xtee9.ci.kit where is the WSDL registered.

Mock service will be started at the Jenkins job. Mock service runs cd /opt/riajenk/xrd-soapui-mock

../SoapUI-5.3.0/bin/mockservicerunner.sh

<h2>4.5 Installing performance test</h2>

Performance test file &quot;xroad.scala&quot; should be placed in the gatling/user-files/simulations folder.

<h2>4.6 Command line parameters</h2>

Table will show command line parameters how you can modify the performance test. Variable should be used on the command line as -Dvariable=value.

| **Parameter** | **Default value** | **Value information** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xRoadURL | http://127.0.0.1:8080/ | X-road security server |
| memberCode | 11045744 | X-road client and provider code |
| rpsTargets | 1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50 | Target request per second (req/s) |
| warmUpHoldPeriod | 30 | Warm-up lenght (sek) |
| mainHoldPeriod | 600 | Period of holding threads (sek) |
| userBumpInterval | 3 | Ramp-up period(sek) |
| weight2kB | 30.0 | The proportion of messages 2kB (%) |
| weight10kB | 60.0 | The proportion of messages 10kB (%) |
| weight100kB | 9.0 | The proportion of messages 100kB (%) |
| weight2MB | 0.9 | The proportion of messages 2MB(%) |
| weight10MB | 0.1 | The proportion of messages 10MB (%) |

Gatling performance test is not sending out messages in different size, it will send &quot;desiredResponseSize&quot; parameter, what indicates to mock service on which size should the response be. If users change the percentage of the sizes it is important to control that all size percentages summ will be 100.

<h2>4.7 Installing performance test</h2>

Performance test file &quot;xroad.scala&quot; should be placed in the /var/lib/jenkins/gatling-charts-highcharts-bundle-2.2.3/user-files/simulations folder.

<h2>4.8 Setting up Jenkins to run performance test</h2>

Create new project for performance test - Freestyle project

Add new build step &quot;shell&quot;

Add new post-build actions &quot;Publish HTML report&quot;

<h2>4.9 Running performance test</h2>

User can change build step &quot;shell&quot; script within the paragraph 4.6  mentioned parameters using them like this : **./xroad-gatling.sh -DrpsTargets=10,20 -DmainHoldPeriod=300** (10 threads run 300 seconds and 20 threads run 300 seconds).

These parameters should be added on the shell script on the ./xroad-gatling.sh line.
